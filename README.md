Our team members are Vivian Chen, Anthony Chen, and Jasmine Lai. Our product name is NUFind, a platform where students, management, and club organizers can collaborate and communicate about Northeastern campus activities. 

General students will be able to use NUFind to browse through club events/meetings happening at Northeastern. Searchers are offered a decent array of filters to find an existing event that best fits their interests. There is also a feature to find your friends. 

Club organizers will have the ability to create new events as well as browse their preexisting events. They are offered an easy template to post information about those events.
